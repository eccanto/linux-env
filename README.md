## Neovim

My Neovim configuration: [github](https://github.com/eccanto/nvim-config)

# Useful

## Change keyboard layout

```bash
# change to EspaÃ±ol latam
setxkbmap -layout latam
```

To make this configuration permanent you can add "setxkbmap -layout latam" to `~/.config/i3/config` or use another
autostart configuration file.

```bash
# Autostart applications
exec_always --no-startup-id setxkbmap -layout latam
```

## Search icons in system fonts

```bash
sudo apt install gucharmap

gucharmap
```

## Generate monitor profile

```bash
arandr
```

Relocate the monitors and save the profile "Layout -> Save as" (bash file). You can generate multiple profiles for different situations (home, office, etc.).

## Reconfigure powerlevel10k

```bash
p10k configure
```

## Disable underlining of the powerlevel10k zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin

Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
(( ${+ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES} )) || typeset -A ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES
ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[path]=none
ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[path_prefix]=none
```

## Fix polybar brightness module on amd card

1. get card name:

    ```bash
    $ ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/
    amdgpu_bl0
    ```

2. update polybar configuration file:

    ```bash
    # file: ~/.config/polybar/config
    # card = intel_backlight
    card = amdgpu_bl0
    ```

3. restart polybar

    ```bash
    pkill polybar && polybar i3wmthemer_bar &
    ```

4. [optional] if permission denied

    ```bash
    sudo chmod a+rw /sys/class/backlight/$(ls /sys/class/backlight/ | head -n 1)/brightness
    ```

## Set polybar on multiple screens

1. Create a polybar launcher script:

    ```bash
    # launch_polybar.sh

    if type "xrandr"; then
        for m in $(xrandr --query | grep " connected" | cut -d" " -f1); do
            MONITOR=$m polybar --reload i3wmthemer_bar &
        done
    else
        polybar --reload i3wmthemer_bar &
    fi
    ```

2. Edit the polybar config file (`~/.config/polybar/config`):

    ```
    [bar/i3wmthemer_bar]
    monitor = ${env:MONITOR:}
    ...
    ```

3. Kill current polybar:

    ```
    sudo pkill polybar
    ```

4. Run script:

    ```
    bash launch_polybar.sh
    ```

## Static code analysis tools

These are the linters that will help us to follow good practices and style guides of our source
code. We will be using the following static analysis tools, which will be executed when generating
a new commit in the repository (**git hooks**).

### Set up the Git hooks custom directory

After cloning the repository run the following command in the repository root:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Python Static Checkers

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black): Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type.
- [prospector](https://github.com/PyCQA/prospector): Prospector is a tool to analyse Python code and output information about errors, potential problems, convention violations and complexity.

  Tools executed by Prospector:
  - [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint): Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors,   helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.
  - [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit): Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues.
  - [dodgy](https://github.com/landscapeio/dodgy): It is a series of simple regular expressions designed to detect things such as accidental SCM diff checkins, or passwords or secret keys hard coded into files.
  - [mccabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe): Complexity checker.
  - [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python.
  - [pep257](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle): pep257 is a static analysis tool for checking compliance with Python PEP 257.
  - [pep8](https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.7.x/): pep8 is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.
  - [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes): Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors.
  - [pyroma](https://github.com/regebro/pyroma): Pyroma is a product aimed at giving a rating of how well a Python project complies with the best practices of the Python packaging ecosystem, primarily PyPI, pip, Distribute etc, as well as a list of issues that could be improved.
