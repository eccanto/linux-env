# Useful

## Change keyboard layout

```bash
# change to EspaÃ±ol latam
setxkbmap -layout latam
```

To make this configuration permanent you can add "setxkbmap -layout latam" to `~/.config/i3/config` or use another
autostart configuration file.

```bash
# Autostart applications
exec_always --no-startup-id setxkbmap -layout latam
```

## Search icons in system fonts

```bash
sudo apt install gucharmap

gucharmap
```

## Generate monitor profile

```bash
arandr
```

relocate the monitors and save the profile "Layout -> Save as" (bash file). You can generate multiple profiles for different situations (home, office, etc.).

## reconfigure powerlevel10k

```bash
p10k configure
```

## powerlevel10k plugin - zsh-syntax-highlighting - disabled the underline

Add the following to your .zshrc:

```bash
(( ${+ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES} )) || typeset -A ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES
ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[path]=none
ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[path_prefix]=none
```

# fix polybar brightness module on amd card

1. get card name:

    ```bash
    $ ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/
    amdgpu_bl0
    ```

2. update polybar configuration file:

    ```bash
    # file: ~/.config/polybar/config
    # card = intel_backlight
    card = amdgpu_bl0
    ```

3. restart polybar

    ```bash
    pkill polybar && polybar i3wmthemer_bar &
    ```

4. [optional] if permission denied

    ```bash
    sudo chmod a+rw /sys/class/backlight/$(ls /sys/class/backlight/ | head -n 1)/brightness
    ```

# Static code analysis tools

## Find Problems
